# CLAUDE.md - Course Creator Platform Documentation

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Version**: 3.3.0 - Service-Specific Namespace Refactoring
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-06

## üöÄ MANDATORY SESSION START PROTOCOL

**AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION, CLAUDE CODE MUST:**

### Step 1: Load Core Methodology (30 seconds)
```bash
# Check user preferences (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "Agile"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "TDD"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "parallel"

# Review recent context
python3 .claude/query_memory.py list 20
```

### Step 2: Internalize Methodology (No user reminder needed)
- ‚úÖ User ALWAYS wants Agile + Kanban boards (automatic)
- ‚úÖ User ALWAYS wants TDD - tests BEFORE code (automatic)
- ‚úÖ User ALWAYS wants TodoWrite tracking (automatic)
- ‚úÖ User NEVER wants to be reminded of these preferences
- ‚úÖ For complex tasks: Use Parallel Agent Development System (PADS)

### Step 3: Reference Self-Improvement Framework
- **Read**: `.claude/CLAUDE_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` for behavioral guidelines
- **Read**: `.claude/PARALLEL_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_SYSTEM.md` for parallel workflows
- **Templates**: `.claude/templates/` for TDD, Kanban, session checklists

### Step 4: Confirm Readiness
Silently confirm understanding of:
- Memory-first workflow
- TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Parallel agent development for efficiency
- TodoWrite for task tracking
- Tentative language (no false claims)

**THESE ARE NOW DEFAULT BEHAVIOR - NOT OPTIONAL**

## üö® CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CLAUDE CODE

### 1. NO FALSE SUCCESS CLAIMS
- **NEVER** claim a task is "completed" or "successful" unless you have PROVEN it works through actual testing
- **NEVER** say "‚úÖ" or mark anything as working without concrete evidence
- **NEVER** use phrases like "successfully completed", "working correctly", "fixed", "healthy" without verification

### 2. MANDATORY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
- Before claiming ANY task completion, you MUST provide concrete evidence:
  - Service responding to HTTP requests with 200 status
  - Actual command output showing success
  - Container running with "Up (healthy)" status
  - Real test results, not assumptions

### 3. MANDATORY MEMORY TOOL USAGE - ALWAYS FIRST, EVERY TASK

**CRITICAL RULE: MEMORY SEARCH IS THE FIRST ACTION FOR EVERY TASK**

Before doing ANYTHING - before reading files, before writing code, before running commands - you MUST:

1. **Search memory for task-relevant facts** (keywords: technology, feature, component)
2. **Search memory for constraints** (keywords: HTTPS, requirements, architecture)
3. **Review recent context** (`list 20`)

**Memory Tool Commands:**
```bash
# ALWAYS START WITH THESE - NO EXCEPTIONS
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "relevant_keyword"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "constraints"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py list 20

# Add new facts AFTER discoveries
python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "<fact_content>" "<category>" "<importance>"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents repeating mistakes (like using HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- Ensures critical requirements aren't forgotten
- Maintains consistency with user preferences
- Avoids redundant work

**Mandatory Memory Workflow:**
1. **BEFORE** making any technical decision ‚Üí Search memory for relevant facts
2. **DURING** investigation ‚Üí Document findings as you discover them
3. **AFTER** fixing bugs ‚Üí Add facts about root cause and solution
4. **NEVER** assume you know something ‚Üí Verify it exists in memory first

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# User says: "The platform uses HTTPS only"
# Step 1: Search memory to verify
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "HTTPS"
# Found: ID 300 confirms HTTPS-only requirement

# Step 2: Work on the task using this fact

# Step 3: Add new discovery
python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "Service endpoint discovered: /users/me (not /api/v1/users/me)" "api-endpoints" "critical"
```

### 4. MEMORY AND STATE TRACKING
- **ALWAYS** maintain accurate state of what has been attempted vs. what actually works
- If something failed before, acknowledge it failed and explain what's different this time
- Keep track of which services/components are genuinely working vs. still broken

### 5. TRUTHFUL STATUS REPORTING
When reporting status, use only these categories:
- **WORKING**: Verified with evidence (show the evidence)
- **ATTEMPTED**: Tried but not verified to work
- **BROKEN**: Confirmed not working
- **UNKNOWN**: Not yet tested

### 6. PROBLEM ACKNOWLEDGMENT
- If you encounter the same error repeatedly, STOP and acknowledge the pattern
- Don't keep trying the same approach that already failed
- Ask for guidance when stuck in loops

### 7. NO ASSUMPTION-BASED CLAIMS
- Don't claim something works because "the code looks right"
- Don't assume Docker containers work because they built successfully
- Verify actual functionality, not just absence of build errors

### 8. SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
**Before claiming ANY fix works, you MUST:**
- **Test the exact failing case** - Copy/paste the exact error scenario and reproduce it
- **Test in the actual environment** - Not just isolated unit tests, but in the real deployment context
- **Provide evidence** - Show the before/after comparison with actual output
- **Wait for user confirmation** - Never declare success, only "attempted fix - please verify"

### 9. LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS
**FORBIDDEN phrases (never use these without concrete proof):**
- ‚úÖ "PROVEN: [anything] is working"
- ‚úÖ "The error should now be resolved"
- ‚úÖ "Pattern/code compiles successfully!"
- ‚úÖ "Both fixes are working"
- ‚úÖ "Successfully completed"
- ‚úÖ "Working correctly"

**REQUIRED language (always use these instead):**
- üîÑ "I've made a change that might fix this. Please test it."
- üîÑ "Here's what I changed and why. Can you verify if it works?"
- üîÑ "The pattern works in my test, but please confirm in your browser."
- üîÑ "Attempted fix deployed - needs user verification"

### 10. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT
**When debugging, you MUST:**
- **Understand the problem** (not just pattern-match visual symptoms)
- **Research the root cause** (don't guess based on superficial similarities)
- **Test exact scenario** (reproduce the exact failure first)
- **Make minimal changes** (one thing at a time)
- **Document uncertainty** (what you're not sure about)

### 11. ANTI-PATTERN RECOGNITION
**Recognize and STOP these harmful patterns:**
- Visual pattern recognition ‚Üí quick fix instinct ‚Üí biased testing
- "This looks wrong" ‚Üí make change ‚Üí assume it's fixed
- Deployment success ‚Üí claim functional success
- Isolated test passes ‚Üí claim real-world functionality
- Speed/confidence prioritized over accuracy/verification

### 12. EPISTEMOLOGICAL HUMILITY
**Acknowledge the limits of what you can know:**
- You cannot directly interact with user browsers
- You cannot see actual user experience
- Your tests are simulations, not reality
- Deployment ‚â† functionality
- Code compilation ‚â† runtime success

## üö® Critical Code Directives (Always Apply)

### 1. Python Import Requirements
**ABSOLUTE IMPORTS ONLY** - Never use relative imports (`from ..`, `from .`) in Python files.

**SERVICE-SPECIFIC NAMESPACES** - All services use service-specific namespaces to prevent collision:

**9 Services with Clean Architecture (domain/application/infrastructure layers):**
- `analytics` ‚Üí imports from `analytics.domain.*`, `analytics.application.*`, `analytics.infrastructure.*`
- `content-management` ‚Üí imports from `content_management.domain.*`, `content_management.application.*`, `content_management.infrastructure.*`
- `course-generator` ‚Üí imports from `course_generator.domain.*`, `course_generator.application.*`, `course_generator.infrastructure.*`
- `course-management` ‚Üí imports from `course_management.domain.*`, `course_management.application.*`, `course_management.infrastructure.*`
- `knowledge-graph-service` ‚Üí imports from `knowledge_graph_service.domain.*`, `knowledge_graph_service.application.*`, `knowledge_graph_service.infrastructure.*`
- `metadata-service` ‚Üí imports from `metadata_service.domain.*`, `metadata_service.application.*`, `metadata_service.infrastructure.*`
- `nlp-preprocessing` ‚Üí imports from `nlp_preprocessing.domain.*`, `nlp_preprocessing.application.*`, `nlp_preprocessing.infrastructure.*`
- `organization-management` ‚Üí imports from `organization_management.domain.*`, `organization_management.application.*`, `organization_management.infrastructure.*`
- `user-management` ‚Üí imports from `user_management.domain.*`, `user_management.application.*`, `user_management.infrastructure.*`

**Directory Structure:**
```
services/SERVICE-NAME/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service_name_package/       # ‚Üê New namespace directory (underscored)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/                 # ‚Üê Domain layer under service namespace
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/            # ‚Üê Application layer under service namespace
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/         # ‚Üê Infrastructure layer under service namespace
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_access/                # ‚Üê Shared DAOs (not in namespace)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                        # ‚Üê API endpoints (not in namespace)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                     # ‚Üê Service entry point
```

**Import Examples:**
```python
# OLD (namespace collision - DO NOT USE):
from domain.entities.course import Course
from application.services.course_service import CourseService

# NEW (service-specific namespace - USE THIS):
from course_management.domain.entities.course import Course
from course_management.application.services.course_service import CourseService
```

**Note**: Service directory names use hyphens (`content-management`), but Python package names use underscores (`content_management`).

### 2. Exception Handling
**CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS MANDATORY** - Never use generic `except Exception as e` handlers. Use structured custom exceptions with f-strings.

### 3. Documentation Requirements
**COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION** - All code must include multiline string documentation explaining business context and technical rationale.

### 4. Memory System Usage
**MANDATORY MEMORY SYSTEM** - Must use the persistent memory system for context continuity across conversations.

### 5. File Type-Specific Comment Syntax
- Python: `"""multiline strings"""` 
- JavaScript: `//` or `/* */`
- CSS: `/* */`
- HTML: `<!-- -->`
- YAML: `#`
- SQL: `--` or `/* */`
- Bash: `#`
