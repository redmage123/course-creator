# Documentation Standards

## Comprehensive Code Documentation Standards (v2.4)

**CRITICAL**: All code in this repository must be extensively documented with multiline strings and comprehensive comments explaining both what the code does and why it does it. This documentation standard has been implemented across multiple services and must be maintained for all future development.

## Documentation Requirements

### Multiline String Documentation
**PREFERRED**: Use multiline strings (triple quotes) for comprehensive explanations rather than # comments wherever appropriate:

**CRITICAL RESTRICTION**: Python multiline string syntax (`"""` or `'''`) must ONLY be used in Python files. Never use Python multiline syntax in non-Python files such as:
- YAML files (use `#` comments)
- JSON files (comments not supported)
- SQL files (use `--` or `/* */` comments)
- JavaScript files (use `//` or `/* */` comments)
- CSS files (use `/* */` comments)
- HTML files (use `<!-- -->` comments)
- Bash scripts (use `#` comments)
- Docker files (use `#` comments)

COMPREHENSIVE SESSION VALIDATION ON PAGE LOAD

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:
When a user refreshes the dashboard page after session expiry,
they should be redirected to the home page, not stay on the dashboard
with default username display.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Check if user data exists in localStorage
2. Validate session timestamps against timeout thresholds  
3. Check if authentication token is present and valid
4. Verify user has correct role for dashboard access
5. Redirect to home page if any validation fails
6. Prevent dashboard initialization for expired sessions

WHY THIS PREVENTS THE BUG:
- Previous code only checked if currentUser existed, not if session was valid
- Expired sessions could still have currentUser data in localStorage
- This led to dashboard loading with fallback usernames
- Now we validate the complete session state before allowing access

```

### JavaScript Documentation Standards
```javascript
/*
Session Management Configuration and Business Requirements

SECURITY TIMEOUT CONFIGURATION:
- SESSION_TIMEOUT: 8 hours (28,800,000 ms) - Maximum session duration
- INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT: 2 hours (7,200,000 ms) - Inactivity threshold
- AUTO_LOGOUT_WARNING: 5 minutes (300,000 ms) - Warning before expiry

WHY THESE SPECIFIC TIMEOUTS:

8-Hour Absolute Session Timeout:
- Aligns with standard work day expectations
- Balances security with user convenience
- Prevents indefinite session persistence
- Meets educational platform security requirements
- Reduces risk of session hijacking over time
*/
this.SESSION_TIMEOUT = 8 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
```

### CSS Documentation Standards
```css
/*
SIDEBAR SCROLLBAR AND LAYOUT FIX

PROBLEMS ADDRESSED:
1. Missing scrollbar when content exceeds viewport height
2. Sidebar overlapping header when zoomed in
3. Inconsistent z-index causing layout conflicts

SOLUTION:
- Force scrollbar visibility with scrollbar-gutter: stable
- Ensure proper z-index hierarchy (sidebar below header)
- Add webkit scrollbar styling for better UX
- Prevent sidebar from covering top navigation at high zoom levels
*/

.dashboard-sidebar {
    scrollbar-gutter: stable;
    /* Additional CSS properties... */
}
```

## Documentation Content Requirements

Each documented code section must include:

1. **Business Context** - Why this code exists and what business problem it solves
2. **Technical Implementation** - How the code works and its approach
3. **Problem Analysis** - What specific issues the code addresses
4. **Solution Rationale** - Why this particular solution was chosen
5. **Edge Cases** - Special conditions and how they're handled
6. **Security Considerations** - Any security implications or protections
7. **Performance Impact** - How the code affects system performance
8. **Maintenance Notes** - Important information for future developers

```

## Services Requiring Documentation Implementation

The following services still need comprehensive multiline documentation applied:

- **`services/analytics/`** - Analytics service Python files
- **`services/organization-management/`** - RBAC system Python files  
- **`services/lab-manager/`** - Lab management Python files
- **Remaining frontend JavaScript files** - Additional JS modules
- **Remaining CSS files** - Component and layout stylesheets
- **HTML templates** - Frontend dashboard and component templates
- **Utility and configuration files** - Setup scripts and configuration modules

## Documentation Maintenance

- **All new code** must follow these documentation standards
- **Existing code modifications** must include updated documentation
- **Code reviews** must verify documentation completeness and quality
- **Documentation consistency** must be maintained across similar components

This documentation standard ensures that all developers can understand not just what the code does, but why it was implemented in a specific way, what problems it solves, and how to maintain it effectively.
