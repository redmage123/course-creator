Authentication Application Service - Secure User Authentication Implementation

This module implements the authentication business logic for the User Management
Service, providing secure user authentication, password management, and credential
validation capabilities.

Service Architecture:
    Application Layer Service: Orchestrates authentication business logic
    Domain Service Implementation: Implements IAuthenticationService interface
    Security First Design: Built-in security features and best practices
    Dependency Injection: Uses repository abstractions for data access

Core Security Features:
    - Secure password hashing using bcrypt with salt
    - Password strength validation and enforcement
    - Secure temporary password generation
    - Authentication attempt validation
    - User account status verification
    - Login activity tracking and audit trail

Password Security Implementation:
    - bcrypt hashing algorithm with automatic salt generation
    - Configurable hashing rounds for performance/security balance
    - Password strength requirements (length, complexity)
    - Secure random password generation for resets
    - Protection against timing attacks in password verification

Business Logic Implementation:
    - User authentication with email/password credentials
    - Password change flows with old password verification
    - Password reset workflows with temporary passwords
    - Account lockout and security incident response
    - Password policy enforcement and validation

Integration Points:
    - User Repository: User data access and persistence
    - Session Service: Session creation after successful authentication
    - Email Service: Password reset notifications (future enhancement)
    - Audit Service: Security event logging (future enhancement)

Security Considerations:
    - Password hashes are stored separately from user profiles
    - Timing attack protection in authentication flows
    - Secure password generation with cryptographic randomness
    - Password strength validation prevents weak passwords
    - Account status verification prevents unauthorized access

Design Patterns Applied:
    - Service Layer Pattern: Encapsulates authentication business logic
    - Strategy Pattern: Configurable password hashing algorithms
    - Template Method: Consistent password validation and generation
    - Dependency Injection: Testable and maintainable dependencies
