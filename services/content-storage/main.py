Content Storage Service - Advanced File Management & Storage Architecture

This module implements the main FastAPI application for the Content Storage Service,
a critical component of the Course Creator Platform responsible for:

1. CONTENT STORAGE ARCHITECTURE:
   - Multi-backend storage support (Local filesystem, AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud)
   - Hierarchical file organization with UUID-based naming for security
   - Atomic file operations with transaction-safe uploads and deletions
   - Content versioning and lifecycle management with automated cleanup
   - Storage optimization through compression and deduplication strategies

2. SECURITY & ACCESS CONTROL:
   - File type validation with configurable allow/block lists
   - Content scanning and malware detection integration points
   - Secure file naming to prevent path traversal attacks
   - Access control integration with platform RBAC system
   - Audit logging for all file operations and access patterns

3. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY:
   - Asynchronous file operations for high throughput
   - Configurable file size limits and storage quotas per user
   - Efficient metadata indexing for fast content discovery
   - Lazy loading and streaming for large file downloads
   - Background processing for content analysis and optimization

4. RELIABILITY & DISASTER RECOVERY:
   - Automated backup strategies with configurable retention policies
   - Storage health monitoring with real-time alerting
   - Redundant storage options for critical educational content
   - Transactional integrity ensuring data consistency
   - Recovery procedures for corrupted or missing files

5. INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
   - RESTful API design following OpenAPI standards
   - Event-driven architecture for content lifecycle notifications
   - Integration with course management for content assignment
   - Analytics integration for usage tracking and optimization
   - Content delivery network (CDN) preparation for global distribution

ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES:
- SOLID design principles throughout the codebase
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Dependency injection for testability and flexibility
- Clean separation of concerns between storage backends
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful user feedback

This service serves as the foundation for all educational content management
within the platform, ensuring reliable, secure, and performant file operations
at scale while maintaining compliance with educational data protection requirements.

    Application Lifespan Manager for Content Storage Service
    
    Manages the complete lifecycle of the content storage service from startup
    to shutdown, ensuring proper initialization of all storage components and
    graceful cleanup of resources.
    
    STARTUP OPERATIONS:
    1. Database Connection Initialization:
       - Establishes connection pool to PostgreSQL for metadata storage
       - Creates necessary tables if they don't exist (content, storage_quotas, etc.)
       - Validates database schema and performs any required migrations
    
    2. Storage Backend Configuration:
       - Initializes the configured storage backend (local/S3/Azure/GCS)
       - Validates storage paths and permissions
       - Sets up backup and retention policies
       - Configures security settings (encryption keys, access controls)
    
    3. Service Dependencies:
       - Initializes content and storage repositories with database connections
       - Creates service instances with proper dependency injection
       - Configures storage quotas and file validation rules
       - Sets up monitoring and health check endpoints
    
    4. Background Tasks:
       - Starts storage health monitoring
       - Initializes cleanup and maintenance schedules
       - Configures backup automation if enabled
       - Sets up content analysis and indexing processes
    
    SHUTDOWN OPERATIONS:
    1. Graceful Connection Closure:
       - Completes any pending file operations
       - Closes database connection pool properly
       - Flushes any cached metadata to persistent storage
    
    2. Resource Cleanup:
       - Cleans up temporary files and incomplete uploads
       - Ensures all file handles are properly closed
       - Saves operational metrics and statistics
    
    This lifespan manager ensures the service starts in a consistent state
    and shuts down cleanly without data loss or resource leaks.
