        BACKUP MONITORING:
        
        1. BACKUP STATUS TRACKING:
           - Identifies most recent successful backup
           - Monitors backup frequency and schedules
           - Validates backup system health
        
        2. DISASTER RECOVERY:
           - Provides recovery point objective (RPO) information
           - Supports business continuity planning
           - Enables backup strategy optimization
        
        3. COMPLIANCE REPORTING:
           - Documents backup compliance status
           - Supports audit and regulatory requirements
           - Validates data protection policies
        
        BACKUP VALIDATION:
        - Only considers successful backup operations
        - Filters by backup operation type
        - Provides accurate recovery capability assessment
        
        MONITORING APPLICATIONS:
        - Backup health dashboards
        - Automated backup alerting
        - Compliance reporting systems
        - Disaster recovery planning
