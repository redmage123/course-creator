        Calculate Total Directory Size for Storage Metrics
        
        Recursively calculates the total size of a directory and all
        its contents, supporting storage analytics and capacity planning.
        
        CALCULATION FEATURES:
        - Recursive directory traversal
        - Comprehensive size calculation
        - Error handling for inaccessible files
        - Performance optimization for large directories
        
        USAGE APPLICATIONS:
        - Backup size calculation and reporting
        - Storage utilization analysis
        - Capacity planning and forecasting
        - Performance monitoring and optimization
