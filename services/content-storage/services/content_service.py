           - Changes content status to 'deleted' instead of physical removal
           - Preserves content metadata for audit and recovery purposes
           - Maintains referential integrity with related data
        
        2. QUOTA MANAGEMENT:
           - Immediately updates user storage quota to free space
           - Adjusts file count limits for the user
           - Enables immediate new uploads within quota
        
        3. ACCESS CONTROL:
           - Removes content from user-visible listings
           - Prevents access to deleted content files
           - Maintains audit trail accessibility
