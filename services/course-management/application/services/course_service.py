Course Service Implementation - Comprehensive Educational Content Management

This module implements the course service layer, orchestrating complex business workflows
for course lifecycle management within the educational platform. It serves as the primary
business logic coordinator between the API layer and the domain/infrastructure layers.

ARCHITECTURAL RESPONSIBILITIES:
The CourseService encapsulates all course-related business operations, enforcing domain
rules, coordinating with external services, and maintaining data consistency across the
educational platform's course management workflows.

BUSINESS WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION:
1. Course Creation: Validation, ID generation, and initial state setup
2. Publication Lifecycle: Draft → Published → Archived state management
3. Content Validation: Educational standards and quality assurance
4. Instructor Authorization: Ownership verification and permission enforcement
5. Search and Discovery: Content filtering and categorization support
6. Analytics Integration: Performance metrics and statistical reporting

DOMAIN RULE ENFORCEMENT:
- Course Quality Standards: Minimum content requirements for publication
- Instructor Ownership: Secure course access and modification controls
- Educational Taxonomy: Proper categorization and difficulty classification
- Enrollment Constraints: Active enrollment validation before course deletion
- Publication Requirements: Comprehensive readiness validation

INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
- Repository Pattern: Clean separation between business logic and data persistence
- Domain Events: Course lifecycle events for analytics and notification systems
- Service Composition: Coordination with enrollment and feedback services
- External APIs: Integration with content management and user services

EDUCATIONAL PLATFORM FEATURES:
- Course Duplication: Efficient course template and variant management
- Statistical Reporting: Enrollment metrics and performance analytics
- Search Functionality: Advanced filtering and content discovery
- Quality Assurance: Educational standards validation and enforcement
- Lifecycle Management: Complete course state and transition control

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Lazy Loading: Efficient data access patterns for course-related entities
- Caching Strategy: Optimized retrieval for frequently accessed course data
- Batch Operations: Efficient processing for bulk course management
- Async Operations: Non-blocking I/O for database and external service interactions

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE:
- Course Analytics: Enrollment trends, completion rates, and revenue tracking
- Instructor Insights: Teaching effectiveness and content performance metrics
- Platform Metrics: Usage patterns and educational outcome analysis
- Quality Metrics: Content effectiveness and student satisfaction correlation

ERROR HANDLING AND RESILIENCE:
- Validation Errors: Comprehensive input validation with educational context
- Authorization Failures: Secure error handling for access control violations
- Data Consistency: Transaction management for multi-step operations
- External Dependencies: Graceful degradation for service unavailability

    Comprehensive course management service implementing educational business workflows.
    
    This service coordinates all course-related operations, from initial creation through
    publication, enrollment management, and eventual archival. It enforces educational
    standards, maintains data integrity, and provides rich analytics integration.
    
    DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
    - Single Responsibility: Focused exclusively on course management business logic
    - Dependency Inversion: Depends on repository abstractions for data persistence
    - Open/Closed: Extensible through composition and interface implementation
    - Interface Segregation: Clean contract definition via ICourseService interface
    
    BUSINESS CAPABILITIES:
    1. Course Lifecycle Management: Complete CRUD operations with state transitions
    2. Quality Assurance: Educational standards validation and publication requirements
    3. Instructor Authorization: Secure ownership verification and permission enforcement
    4. Discovery Services: Advanced search, filtering, and categorization support
    5. Analytics Integration: Performance metrics and statistical reporting
    6. Content Management: Duplication, templating, and variant management
    
    EDUCATIONAL WORKFLOWS:
    - Creation Process: Metadata validation → ID generation → Persistence → Event publishing
    - Publication Workflow: Readiness validation → State transition → Visibility control
    - Modification Process: Ownership verification → Business rule validation → Update persistence
    - Deletion Process: Dependency validation → Authorization check → Soft/hard deletion
    
    INTEGRATION COORDINATION:
    - Enrollment Service: Validates active enrollments before course modifications
    - Analytics Service: Provides course performance and statistical data
    - Content Service: Coordinates with slides, quizzes, and lab materials
    - User Service: Verifies instructor credentials and authorization
    
    PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
    - Async Operations: Non-blocking I/O for all database and external service calls
    - Efficient Querying: Optimized data access patterns with pagination support
    - Caching Integration: Repository-level caching for frequently accessed courses
    - Batch Processing: Optimized handling of bulk course operations
