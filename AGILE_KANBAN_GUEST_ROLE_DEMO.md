## üìã Product Backlog

### Epic 1: Guest Role RBAC System
**Business Value**: Allow anonymous users to explore platform without registration, reducing friction for potential customers

**User Stories**:
1. ‚úÖ As an **anonymous user**, I want to **access a guest role automatically** so that **I can explore the platform without registration**
2. ‚úÖ As a **guest user**, I want to **access the demo service** so that **I can see realistic platform features**
3. ‚úÖ As a **guest user**, I want to **browse public course catalog** so that **I can see what courses are available**
4. ‚úÖ As a **guest user**, I want to **use AI assistant with limits** so that **I can ask questions about the platform**
5. ‚úÖ As a **guest user**, I want **clear prompts to register** so that **I understand how to get full access**

### Epic 2: Demo Service Enhancement
**Business Value**: Showcase ALL platform features (AI, RAG, content generation, labs) to increase conversion rates

**User Stories**:
1. ‚úÖ As a **sales person**, I want to **demonstrate AI-powered content generation** so that **customers see the platform's intelligence**
2. ‚úÖ As a **sales person**, I want to **show RAG-enhanced learning** so that **customers understand the knowledge graph value**
3. ‚úÖ As a **sales person**, I want to **demonstrate Docker lab environments** so that **customers see hands-on learning capabilities**
4. ‚úÖ As a **sales person**, I want to **showcase multi-role workflows** so that **customers see instructor, student, and admin experiences**
5. ‚úÖ As a **sales person**, I want to **show analytics dashboards** so that **customers see data-driven insights**

### Epic 3: Guest-Demo Integration
**Business Value**: Seamless guest experience with demo service access and conversion tracking

**User Stories**:
1. ‚úÖ As a **guest user**, I want **automatic demo session creation** so that **I can start exploring immediately**
2. ‚úÖ As a **guest user**, I want **time-limited demo sessions** so that **I understand the trial nature**
3. ‚úÖ As a **marketing team**, I want to **track which demo features drive registration** so that **we can optimize conversion**
4. ‚úÖ As a **guest user**, I want **clear session expiration warnings** so that **I'm not surprised when my session ends**

## üìù Notes

**TDD Reminder**: Always follow RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR cycle
1. **RED**: Write test that fails
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

**Agile Reminder**:
- Deliver working software incrementally
- Welcome changing requirements
- Reflect and adjust regularly
- Prioritize working software over comprehensive documentation (but still document!)

**Memory System Reminder**:
- Search memory BEFORE starting each task
- Add discoveries to memory DURING work
- Update memory AFTER completing tasks
