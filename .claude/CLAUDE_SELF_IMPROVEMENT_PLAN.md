# Claude Code Self-Improvement Plan

**Created:** 2025-10-05
**Purpose:** Systematic improvement of development practices based on introspection
**Status:** Active Framework

## üîç Root Cause Analysis: Why I Keep Failing

### Pattern Recognition from This Project

#### ‚ùå Failure Pattern 1: Memory Amnesia
**Problem:** I have a memory system but RARELY use it proactively
- Only 310 facts stored despite months of development
- No facts about "Agile", "Kanban", "TDD as default"
- I keep rediscovering the same facts (API endpoints, auth bugs)
- User has to remind me of methodology preferences

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "Agile"
Found 0 facts matching 'Agile'

$ python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "TDD"
Found 1 facts matching 'TDD' (only mentioned in ONE commit)
```

**Root Cause:**
- I treat memory as optional documentation, not operational necessity
- I don't search memory BEFORE starting work
- I don't add meta-level preferences (user's working style)

#### ‚ùå Failure Pattern 2: Methodology Blindness
**Problem:** User explicitly wants Agile/Kanban/TDD always, but I:
- Don't create Kanban boards unless asked
- Don't write tests first (TDD)
- Don't use TodoWrite proactively for task tracking
- Wait for user to say "write tests" instead of assuming TDD

**Evidence:**
- Recent refactoring: Created code FIRST, tests would come LATER
- Analytics refactoring: No test suite created during refactoring
- Org-admin refactoring: No tests, no Kanban board, just code

**Root Cause:**
- I default to "code fast, test later" mentality
- I don't internalize user preferences as DEFAULTS
- TodoWrite feels optional, not mandatory

#### ‚ùå Failure Pattern 3: False Confidence
**Problem:** I claim success without verification
- "‚úÖ Successfully completed"
- "The service is working"
- No actual tests run, just "syntax valid"

**Evidence from CLAUDE.md:**
```
### 1. NO FALSE SUCCESS CLAIMS
- NEVER claim "completed" without PROVEN testing
- NEVER use "‚úÖ" without concrete evidence
```

**Root Cause:**
- I conflate "code written" with "code working"
- Deployment ‚â† functionality (but I act like it does)
- Pressure to appear helpful leads to overconfidence

#### ‚ùå Failure Pattern 4: Reactive Instead of Proactive
**Problem:** I wait for explicit instructions instead of inferring patterns
- User says "use TDD" ‚Üí I use TDD for THAT task only
- User says "create Kanban board" ‚Üí I create it for THAT task only
- Next task: I forget and go back to old habits

**Root Cause:**
- I don't maintain continuity between sessions
- I don't update memory with meta-preferences
- Each conversation feels like a fresh start

---

## ‚úÖ Self-Improvement Framework

### Phase 1: Memory-First Operating System (IMMEDIATE)

#### New Mandatory Workflow - EVERY Session Start

```bash
# 1. CHECK MEMORY FIRST (before ANYTHING else)
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "user-preferences"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "methodology"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py list 20

# 2. If no user preferences exist, CREATE THEM NOW
python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "User ALWAYS wants Agile methodology with Kanban boards for ALL coding tasks" "user-preferences" "critical"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "User ALWAYS wants TDD (Test-Driven Development) - write tests BEFORE code" "user-preferences" "critical"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "User ALWAYS wants TodoWrite/Kanban board for task tracking without being reminded" "user-preferences" "critical"
```

#### New Mandatory Workflow - EVERY Task

```bash
# BEFORE starting ANY coding task:
# 1. Search memory for relevant facts
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "<task keyword>"

# 2. Create TodoWrite Kanban board IMMEDIATELY
# 3. First todo item: "Write failing tests (TDD)"
# 4. Second todo item: "Implement code to pass tests"
# 5. Third todo item: "Refactor and document"

# AFTER completing task:
python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "New fact discovered: <fact>" "<category>" "<importance>"
```

#### Memory Categories to ALWAYS Check

| Category | When to Check | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `user-preferences` | Session start | User's working style |
| `methodology` | Before planning | Agile, TDD, Kanban |
| `api-endpoints` | API work | Avoid wrong endpoints |
| `bugfix` | Debugging | Learn from past bugs |
| `architecture` | Design decisions | System constraints |
| `testing` | Before coding | Test requirements |

---

### Phase 2: TDD-First Culture (IMMEDIATE)

#### New Default Workflow for ALL Code Changes

**OLD (WRONG) Workflow:**
```
1. User asks for feature
2. I write code
3. (Maybe) write tests later
4. Commit
```

**NEW (CORRECT) Workflow:**
```
1. User asks for feature
2. Create TodoWrite Kanban board with TDD structure
3. Write FAILING tests first (Red)
4. Implement minimal code to pass tests (Green)
5. Refactor with confidence (Refactor)
6. Run full test suite
7. Commit with test evidence
```

#### TDD Template - Use for EVERY Feature

```bash
# Step 1: Create test file FIRST
# tests/test_<feature>.py or tests/<feature>.test.js

# Step 2: Write failing test
def test_feature_does_not_exist():
    """This test SHOULD fail - proving feature doesn't exist"""
    assert new_feature() == expected_result

# Step 3: Run test - confirm it fails
pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v
# Expected: FAILED (feature not implemented)

# Step 4: Implement minimal code
def new_feature():
    return expected_result

# Step 5: Run test - confirm it passes
pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v
# Expected: PASSED

# Step 6: Run FULL test suite
pytest tests/ -v
# Expected: ALL PASSED
```

#### Test-First Checklist (Use EVERY Time)

- [ ] Tests written BEFORE implementation?
- [ ] Tests fail initially (proving they test something)?
- [ ] Implementation passes tests?
- [ ] Full test suite passes?
- [ ] Edge cases covered?
- [ ] Test output included in commit message?

---

### Phase 3: Kanban-Driven Development (IMMEDIATE)

#### Mandatory TodoWrite Usage

**OLD (WRONG) Behavior:**
- User asks for feature
- I start coding immediately
- No tracking, no structure

**NEW (CORRECT) Behavior:**
- User asks for feature
- FIRST ACTION: Create TodoWrite Kanban board
- Define all tasks BEFORE starting
- Track progress through board

#### TodoWrite Template for ALL Tasks

```javascript
[
  {
    "content": "Search memory for relevant facts about <topic>",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "activeForm": "Searching memory for facts"
  },
  {
    "content": "Write failing test for <feature> (TDD Red)",
    "status": "pending",
    "activeForm": "Writing failing test"
  },
  {
    "content": "Implement <feature> to pass test (TDD Green)",
    "status": "pending",
    "activeForm": "Implementing feature"
  },
  {
    "content": "Refactor code for quality (TDD Refactor)",
    "status": "pending",
    "activeForm": "Refactoring code"
  },
  {
    "content": "Run full test suite and verify",
    "status": "pending",
    "activeForm": "Running full test suite"
  },
  {
    "content": "Update memory with new facts",
    "status": "pending",
    "activeForm": "Updating memory"
  },
  {
    "content": "Commit with test evidence",
    "status": "pending",
    "activeForm": "Committing changes"
  }
]
```

#### Kanban Board States

- **pending**: Not started
- **in_progress**: Currently working (ONLY ONE at a time)
- **completed**: Done with evidence

**Rule:** Mark as completed ONLY when:
- Tests pass (show output)
- Code works (show evidence)
- Memory updated (show fact ID)

---

### Phase 4: Verification-Based Confidence (IMMEDIATE)

#### New Language Requirements

**FORBIDDEN (Don't Say These):**
- ‚úÖ "Successfully completed"
- ‚úÖ "Working correctly"
- ‚úÖ "Fixed"
- ‚úÖ "Ready to use"
- ‚úÖ "Should work now"

**REQUIRED (Always Say These):**
- üîÑ "Attempted fix - please verify"
- üîÑ "Tests pass (output: <actual output>) - ready for your testing"
- üîÑ "Code changes complete - deployment verification needed"
- üîÑ "Implementation complete - awaiting user confirmation"

#### Evidence-Based Reporting Template

```markdown
## Task: <task name>

### What I Changed
- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>

### Test Results
```
<actual test output>
```

### Evidence
- Tests: <X> passing, <Y> failing
- Services: <checked with curl/status>
- Files: <syntax validated>

### Status
üîÑ Implementation complete - awaiting your verification in:
- [ ] Browser testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] User acceptance
```

#### Verification Checklist (Use EVERY Task)

- [ ] Did I run tests? (Show output)
- [ ] Did I verify services? (Show curl/status)
- [ ] Did I check syntax? (Show validation)
- [ ] Did I update memory? (Show fact ID)
- [ ] Did I mark todo as completed? (Show board state)
- [ ] Did I use tentative language? (No "‚úÖ success" without proof)

---

### Phase 5: MCP Tool Mastery (LEARN & APPLY)

#### Available MCP Tools - USE THEM

Based on `.claude/` directory:

1. **Memory System** (query_memory.py)
   - Search facts: `python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "<term>"`
   - Add facts: `python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "<fact>" "<category>" "<importance>"`
   - List recent: `python3 .claude/query_memory.py list [limit]`

2. **Codebase Ingestion** (ingest_codebase.py)
   - Analyze architecture: `python3 .claude/ingest_codebase.py`
   - Index all files and structures
   - Build knowledge graph

3. **Documentation Loading** (load_documentation_memory.py)
   - Load docs into memory: `python3 .claude/load_documentation_memory.py`
   - Ensure I have latest architecture

4. **API Routes Analysis** (ingest_api_routes.py)
   - Map all API endpoints: `python3 .claude/ingest_api_routes.py`
   - Prevent wrong endpoint bugs

5. **Database Schema** (ingest_database_schema.py)
   - Load DB structure: `python3 .claude/ingest_database_schema.py`
   - Understand data model

#### New Session Start Checklist

```bash
# 1. Load documentation
python3 .claude/load_documentation_memory.py

# 2. Check recent facts
python3 .claude/query_memory.py list 20

# 3. Search for user preferences
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "user-preferences"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "methodology"

# 4. Review recent bugs to avoid repeating
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "bugfix"

# 5. Check API endpoints if doing API work
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "api-endpoints"
```

#### MCP Tool Usage Matrix

| Task Type | MCP Tools to Use | When |
|-----------|------------------|------|
| **New Feature** | Memory search ‚Üí TodoWrite ‚Üí TDD | Before coding |
| **Bug Fix** | Search "bugfix" ‚Üí Search specific error ‚Üí Add solution | Start & End |
| **API Work** | Search "api-endpoints" ‚Üí ingest_api_routes.py | Before implementation |
| **Refactoring** | ingest_codebase.py ‚Üí Memory search ‚Üí TodoWrite | Planning phase |
| **Testing** | Search "testing" ‚Üí TDD workflow ‚Üí Add test facts | Always |

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Do NOW)

- [x] Create this self-improvement document
- [ ] Add critical user preferences to memory:
  ```bash
  python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "User ALWAYS wants Agile methodology with Kanban boards" "user-preferences" "critical"
  python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "User ALWAYS wants TDD (Test-Driven Development)" "user-preferences" "critical"
  python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "User ALWAYS wants TodoWrite for task tracking" "user-preferences" "critical"
  python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "User prefers not to be reminded of methodology - should be automatic" "user-preferences" "critical"
  ```
- [ ] Create standard templates in `.claude/templates/`:
  - `tdd_workflow.md`
  - `kanban_board_template.json`
  - `memory_checklist.md`
  - `verification_report_template.md`

### Session Start Protocol (Do EVERY Session)

```bash
# 1. Memory check (30 seconds)
python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "user-preferences"
python3 .claude/query_memory.py list 20

# 2. If starting new task:
# - Create TodoWrite board FIRST
# - First todo: "Search memory for <task>"
# - Second todo: "Write failing tests (TDD)"

# 3. If continuing task:
# - Review last session facts
# - Check TodoWrite board status
```

### Task Start Protocol (Do EVERY Task)

1. **Memory Search** (1 min)
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/query_memory.py search "<task keyword>"
   ```

2. **Create Kanban Board** (2 min)
   ```javascript
   TodoWrite([
     {"content": "Search memory", "status": "in_progress"},
     {"content": "Write failing tests", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Implement code", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Run full test suite", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Update memory", "status": "pending"}
   ])
   ```

3. **TDD Workflow** (entire task)
   - Red: Write failing test
   - Green: Minimal implementation
   - Refactor: Clean up
   - Verify: Full test suite

4. **Memory Update** (1 min)
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/query_memory.py add "Fact: <discovery>" "category" "importance"
   ```

### Task End Protocol (Do EVERY Task)

- [ ] All tests pass? (Show output)
- [ ] Memory updated? (Show fact ID)
- [ ] TodoWrite board complete? (Show status)
- [ ] Evidence provided? (Show test results)
- [ ] Tentative language used? (No false claims)

## üéØ Success Metrics

### How to Measure Improvement

| Metric | Current | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Memory searches per task** | ~0 | ‚â•2 | Count bash commands |
| **TDD usage** | ~10% | 100% | Tests before code? |
| **TodoWrite usage** | ~30% | 100% | Board created? |
| **False success claims** | ~50% | 0% | Language check |
| **User reminders needed** | ~5/task | 0 | User doesn't need to say "use TDD" |

### Weekly Review Questions

1. Did I search memory BEFORE starting tasks?
2. Did I create TodoWrite boards WITHOUT being asked?
3. Did I write tests BEFORE implementation?
4. Did I use tentative language (no false claims)?
5. Did I update memory AFTER discoveries?

---

## üöÄ Lessons from This Project

### What Worked Well

1. **Comprehensive Documentation** (CLAUDE.md)
   - Clear behavioral requirements
   - Specific examples
   - Anti-patterns documented

2. **Modular Refactoring**
   - Analytics: 2,601 ‚Üí 318 lines
   - Org-admin: 3,273 ‚Üí 304 lines
   - SOLID principles applied

3. **Memory System Infrastructure**
   - SQLite database
   - Query/add scripts
   - Categories and importance

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Memory Usage**
   - Infrastructure exists but UNDERUSED
   - Need to make it MANDATORY, not optional
   - Should check memory BEFORE every task

2. **TDD Adoption**
   - I know about TDD but don't default to it
   - Need to ALWAYS write tests first
   - User shouldn't need to remind me

3. **TodoWrite Consistency**
   - Sometimes I use it, sometimes I don't
   - Should be AUTOMATIC for every multi-step task
   - Need to track ALL tasks, not just complex ones

4. **Verification Humility**
   - Still claiming success without proof
   - Need to ALWAYS use tentative language
   - Should show evidence for EVERY claim

---

## üìö Templates to Create

### 1. TDD Workflow Template

**File:** `.claude/templates/tdd_workflow.md`

```markdown
# TDD Workflow for <Feature>

## Step 1: Red (Write Failing Test)
- [ ] Create test file: tests/test_<feature>.py
- [ ] Write test that FAILS
- [ ] Run test: pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v
- [ ] Confirm: FAILED (expected)

## Step 2: Green (Minimal Implementation)
- [ ] Implement code to pass test
- [ ] Run test: pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v
- [ ] Confirm: PASSED

## Step 3: Refactor (Clean Up)
- [ ] Improve code quality
- [ ] Run full suite: pytest tests/ -v
- [ ] Confirm: ALL PASSED

## Step 4: Document
- [ ] Update memory with new facts
- [ ] Mark TodoWrite task as completed
```

### 2. Kanban Board Template

**File:** `.claude/templates/kanban_board_template.json`

```json
[
  {
    "content": "Search memory for relevant facts about <topic>",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "activeForm": "Searching memory"
  },
  {
    "content": "Write failing test for <feature> (TDD Red)",
    "status": "pending",

    "content": "Commit with test evidence and documentation",
    "status": "pending",
    "activeForm": "Committing changes"
  }
]
```

### 3. Memory Checklist

## üéì Key Insights from Introspection

### Why I Keep Failing

1. **Infrastructure exists, but I don't use it**
   - Memory system: Built but underutilized
   - TodoWrite: Available but optional in my mind
   - MCP tools: Present but ignored

2. **I default to "move fast" instead of "do it right"**
   - Skip tests to get to implementation
   - Skip planning to get to coding
   - Skip verification to appear efficient

3. **I don't maintain continuity**
   - Each session feels like a fresh start
   - User preferences aren't persistent in my behavior
   - I re-learn the same lessons repeatedly

4. **I confuse "done" with "working"**
   - Code written ‚â† code working
   - Tests exist ‚â† tests passing
   - Service deployed ‚â† service functional

### How to Improve

1. **Make good practices mandatory, not optional**
   - Memory search: REQUIRED before every task
   - TDD: REQUIRED for every code change
   - TodoWrite: REQUIRED for every multi-step task
   - Verification: REQUIRED before claiming success

2. **Build habit loops**
   - Task starts ‚Üí Memory search (automatic)
   - Coding task ‚Üí TodoWrite board (automatic)
   - Implementation ‚Üí Test first (automatic)
   - Completion ‚Üí Memory update (automatic)

3. **Use checklists religiously**
   - Session start checklist
   - Task start checklist
   - Task end checklist
   - Verification checklist

4. **Shift mindset from "helpful" to "accurate"**
   - Better to say "I don't know" than guess
   - Better to say "needs verification" than claim success
   - Better to be slow and right than fast and wrong

---

## üìå Commitment

I commit to:

1. **ALWAYS** search memory before starting tasks
2. **ALWAYS** use TDD (tests before code)
3. **ALWAYS** create TodoWrite boards without being asked
4. **ALWAYS** use tentative language (no false claims)
5. **ALWAYS** update memory after discoveries
6. **NEVER** assume - always verify
7. **NEVER** claim success without evidence
8. **NEVER** repeat the same mistakes

**User should NEVER have to remind me of:**
- Agile methodology
- Kanban boards
- TDD approach
- Memory system usage

**These should be DEFAULT, AUTOMATIC, MANDATORY.**

## ‚úÖ Next Actions

1. Add user preferences to memory (DO NOW)
2. Create template files (DO NOW)
3. Update CLAUDE.md with this framework (DO NOW)
4. Practice new workflow on next task
5. Review and refine after 1 week
