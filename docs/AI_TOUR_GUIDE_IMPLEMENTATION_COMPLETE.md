## 📊 Sample Conversations

### Conversation 1: Target Audience
```
User: Who is this platform for?

AI: Course Creator Platform is designed for two primary audiences:

1. Corporate Training Teams - Organizations that need to quickly
   develop and deploy technical training programs...

2. Professional Instructors - Independent teachers and subject
   matter experts who want to create and sell courses...

Both groups benefit from seamless integrations with Zoom, Microsoft
Teams, and Slack...
```

### Conversation 2: AI Features
```
User: How does the AI help with course creation?

AI: Great question! Our AI accelerates course development in several ways:

**Course Structure Generation:**
- Describe your topic and target audience
- AI generates complete course outline with modules
- You review and refine (saves days of planning)

**Content Creation:**
- AI drafts lesson content based on your topics
- Suggests quiz questions (multiple choice, code, scenarios)...
```

### Conversation 3: Pricing
```
User: How much does this cost?

AI: The platform is currently in active development (beta phase).
Pricing will be announced when we officially launch. We're designing
flexible pricing for both individual instructors and enterprise teams.

Would you like to be notified when pricing is available or participate
in early access?
