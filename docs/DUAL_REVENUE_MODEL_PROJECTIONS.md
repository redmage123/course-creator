# Course Creator Platform - Dual Revenue Model Projections

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** November 29, 2025
**Purpose:** Five-year revenue projections for SaaS and Enterprise License models

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents revenue projections for two distinct go-to-market strategies:

| Model | Year 5 Revenue | Characteristics |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Model A: SaaS Only** | $45M ARR | Recurring, predictable, higher valuation multiples |
| **Model B: Enterprise License Only** | $38M | Higher upfront, lumpy, lower valuation |
| **Model C: Hybrid (Recommended)** | $52M | Best of both, diversified revenue |

**Recommendation:** Pursue a **Hybrid Model** with SaaS as primary (70%) and Enterprise License as secondary (30%) to maximize total revenue while maintaining predictable recurring revenue for valuation purposes.
