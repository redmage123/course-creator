## 🎬 Slide 5: Third Party Integrations

### Narration (60s)

> "Now here's where collaboration gets powerful. From the Meeting Rooms tab, organization admins can instantly connect the platform with the tools their teams already use. Create Microsoft Teams channels, Zoom rooms, or Slack channels for every instructor with a single click. Need meeting spaces for all your learning tracks? Bulk creation generates them in seconds.
>
> But it doesn't stop there. Send notifications to specific Slack channels about course updates, or broadcast announcements to your entire organization across Teams. Whether it's urgent maintenance alerts or celebrating student achievements, reach your team where they're already working.
>
> This integration means instructors collaborate on course development in Slack, launch live sessions via Zoom, and coordinate schedules in Teams, all without leaving their workflow. That's seamless collaboration."

### Features Demonstrated

## 🚀 Next Steps for Video Generation

### Phase 1: Prepare Demo Data (30 minutes)

**Prerequisites**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure platform is running
./scripts/app-control.sh start
./scripts/app-control.sh status  # All services should be healthy

# 2. Verify demo users exist
# - demo.orgadmin@example.com (organization admin)
# - demo.instructor@example.com (instructor)
# - demo.student@example.com (student)

# 3. Ensure organization has:
# - 8+ instructors (for bulk creation demo)
# - 2+ tracks (Frontend, Backend)
# - Meeting Rooms tab accessible
```

**Test Manually**:
1. Login as org admin
2. Navigate to Meeting Rooms tab
3. Verify bulk creation buttons work
4. Test Send Notification modal
5. Confirm all UI elements display correctly

### Phase 2: Generate Videos (2-3 hours)

**Start Virtual Display** (if headless):
```bash
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 &
export DISPLAY=:99
```

**Generate NEW Slide 5**:
```bash
# Generate slide 5 first to test
cd /home/bbrelin/course-creator
DISPLAY=:99 python3 scripts/generate_demo_v3_with_integrations.py

# This will generate slides 1-5 by default
# Check output in frontend/static/demo/videos/
```

**Verify Slide 5 Video**:
```bash
# Check file was created
ls -lh frontend/static/demo/videos/slide_05_third_party_integrations.mp4

# Check video properties
ffprobe frontend/static/demo/videos/slide_05_third_party_integrations.mp4

# Preview video
mpv frontend/static/demo/videos/slide_05_third_party_integrations.mp4
```

**Generate All Slides** (optional):
```python
# Edit generate_demo_v3_with_integrations.py line ~565
# Change:
slides_to_generate = slides_data['slides'][:5]

# To:
slides_to_generate = slides_data['slides'][:14]  # All slides

# Then run:
python3 scripts/generate_demo_v3_with_integrations.py
```

### Phase 3: Test Demo Player (15 minutes)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Successful Patterns
1. **Comprehensive Planning First**: Detailed workflow planning prevented implementation issues
2. **Narration Before Video**: Writing narration scripts first ensured clear messaging
3. **Modular Slide Functions**: Each slide as separate async function for maintainability
4. **JavaScript Form Workarounds**: Prepared for known Selenium visibility issues
5. **Documentation Chain**: Each phase documented for future reference

### Technical Solutions
1. **Textarea Visibility**: Use JavaScript `execute_script` instead of `send_keys`
2. **Form Events**: Trigger `input` and `change` events after setting values
3. **Modal Timing**: Wait for backdrop `.show` class, not just presence
4. **Playwright over Selenium**: Better handling of modern web apps
