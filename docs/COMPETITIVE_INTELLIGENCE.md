## 4. Sales Battle Cards

### 4.1 vs. Cornerstone Battle Card

#### Quick Reference
| Aspect | Us | Them |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Founded** | 2024 | 1999 |
| **Architecture** | Cloud-native, microservices | Monolithic legacy |
| **AI** | AI-first, generative | Bolt-on AI features |
| **Implementation** | Weeks | 6-12 months |
| **Labs** | Integrated | None |

#### Landmines to Plant
- "How long will implementation take?"
- "Can you show me AI-generated content?"
- "How do developers get hands-on practice?"
- "What's the total cost including implementation?"

#### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Cornerstone is the safe choice" | "Cornerstone was the safe choice 10 years ago. Today, betting on 20-year-old technology is the risky choice." |
| "They have more features" | "They have more legacy features. We have the features that matter for the future: AI and hands-on learning." |
| "We already have Cornerstone" | "We can start with specific use cases - technical training or new content creation - where we excel." |
| "Their content library is bigger" | "Content libraries solve yesterday's problem. AI generates exactly what you need, when you need it." |

#### Proof Points Needed
- [ ] Customer case study: "Switched from Cornerstone"
- [ ] Implementation time comparison data
- [ ] TCO calculator

### 4.2 vs. Docebo Battle Card

#### Quick Reference
| Aspect | Us | Them |
|--------|-----|------|
| **AI Approach** | Generative, end-to-end | AI features, not AI-native |
| **Labs** | Integrated | None |
| **Pricing** | Transparent, all-in | Complex add-ons |
| **Content Creation** | AI-generated | Manual with AI assist |

#### Landmines to Plant
- "Can the AI generate a complete course from a topic?"
- "Show me the hands-on lab experience"
- "What's the pricing with all features included?"
- "How long does content creation really take?"

#### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Docebo has AI too" | "Docebo added AI features. We were built AI-first. Show me Docebo generating a complete course with quizzes and labs from a single prompt." |
| "They have better social features" | "Fair point on social learning. But if your primary need is content creation and technical training, we're purpose-built for that." |
| "They're publicly traded, more stable" | "Public doesn't mean stable - it means quarterly pressure. We're focused on product excellence and customer success." |

#### Proof Points Needed
- [ ] Side-by-side AI demo comparison
- [ ] Pricing transparency comparison

### 4.3 vs. "Build Our Own" Battle Card

#### Why They Consider Building
- Perceived control over features

- Custom requirements

#### Counter-Arguments

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Control** | "Full API access gives you control. Plus you benefit from our continuous innovation." |
| **Integration** | "We integrate with everything. Building your own means maintaining integrations forever." |
| **Lock-in** | "All your content exports to SCORM/xAPI. We're less lock-in than a custom build." |
| **Custom Needs** | "Our platform is highly configurable. What specific need do you think requires custom build?" |

#### Build vs. Buy Calculator

| Item | Build | Buy (Course Creator) |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Initial Development | $500K-$2M | $0 |
| Annual Maintenance | $200K-$500K | $50K-$200K (subscription) |
