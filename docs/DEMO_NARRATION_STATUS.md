# Demo Narration Updates - Current Status

## What I Actually Updated ✅

### 1. Audio Narration Files (MP3) ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** `frontend/static/demo/audio/slide_*_narration.mp3`
- **What Changed:** All 13 audio files regenerated with ElevenLabs API
- **Content:** Updated voiceover emphasizing AI features, corporate training, Zoom/Teams/Slack integrations
- **Files:** All generated October 9, 2025 at 21:36
- **Status:** ✅ Working - These play during the demo

### 2. Narration Text Overlays ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** `frontend/html/demo-player.html` (slides array, lines 627-719)
- **What Changed:** Updated 7 slides with new narration text
- **Changes:**
  - Slide 1: Added "corporate training teams and professional instructors"
  - Slide 4: Added "Slack or Teams channels"
  - Slide 5: Complete rewrite emphasizing AI course generation
  - Slide 6: Emphasizes "AI really shines"
  - Slide 9: Added "game changer for technical training"
  - Slide 12: "Beyond basic LMS reporting"
  - Slide 13: Clear recap of AI + integrations
- **Status:** ✅ Working - Text displays during demo

### 3. Video Screencasts (MP4) ❌ NOT UPDATED
- **Location:** `frontend/static/demo/videos/slide_*.mp4`
- **What Changed:** NOTHING - These are still the old screencasts
- **Issue:** These videos may show workflows that don't match the updated narrations
- **Status:** ❌ NEEDS REGENERATION

## The Problem

When you watch the demo now:
- ✅ You HEAR updated narration (audio MP3 files)
- ✅ You READ updated text (overlay text)
- ❌ You SEE old platform workflows (video screencasts)

This creates a **mismatch** - the narration talks about AI features and integrations, but the video might be showing different or older workflows.

## Why Videos Weren't Regenerated

The video generation script (`scripts/generate_demo_videos.py`) uses Selenium to automate the platform and FFmpeg to record the screen. It's currently failing with:

```
selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException:
Message: session not created: DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist
```

This is a common issue with headless Chrome in Docker/containerized environments.

## What Needs to Happen

### Option 1: Fix Selenium and Regenerate Videos (Recommended)
**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Steps:**
1. Debug Selenium/Chrome DevTools issues
2. Ensure demo data is seeded correctly
3. Run video generation for all 13 slides
4. Verify each video matches its narration

**Result:** Complete alignment between video, audio, and text

### Option 2: Use Static Screenshots Instead
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Steps:**
1. Take screenshots of key platform features
2. Convert screenshots to simple slideshow videos
3. Replace screencast videos with screenshot-based videos

**Result:** Less dynamic, but ensures visual alignment with narrations

### Option 3: Keep Current Videos (Not Recommended)
**Time:** 0 minutes
**Issue:** Videos won't match updated narrations

## Current Demo Status

**What Works:**
- ✅ AI Tour Guide fully operational
- ✅ Updated audio narrations playing
- ✅ Updated text overlays displaying
- ✅ All Docker containers healthy
- ✅ Demo accessible at https://localhost:3000/html/demo-player.html

**What's Mismatched:**
- ❌ Video screencasts may not visually demonstrate what the narrations describe

---

## Immediate Action Required

**Decision Needed:** Which option should I pursue?

1. **Fix Selenium and regenerate all 13 videos** (2-4 hours, complete solution)
2. **Use static screenshots instead** (30 mins, simpler but less dynamic)
3. **Accept current state** (videos don't perfectly match narrations)

Let me know which approach you'd like me to take.
