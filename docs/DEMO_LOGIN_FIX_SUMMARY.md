# Playwright Login Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Issue**: Login redirect not working in Playwright video generation
**Status**: ðŸ”´ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - Network error prevents JavaScript fetch

---

## Summary

After extensive debugging, the Playwright login fails because the JavaScript `fetch()` call to `/auth/login` returns a network error. This happens even with correct credentials that work in E2E tests.

**Root Cause**: Playwright's page context cannot make the HTTPS fetch request, likely due to:
1. Self-signed certificate issues not properly handled
2. Context security settings blocking the request
3. CORS or mixed content blocking

---

## Solution: Direct API Login + Cookie Injection

Instead of relying on the page's JavaScript to make the fetch request, we'll:
1. Call the `/auth/login` API directly from Python using `requests`
2. Extract the session cookies from the response
3. Inject those cookies into the Playwright browser context
4. Navigate directly to the dashboard

This bypasses all the JavaScript/network issues.

## Recommended Next Steps

Given the time spent debugging (4+ hours) and 6+ failed regeneration attempts, I recommend:

### Option 1: API + Cookie Injection (30 minutes)
- Implement direct Python API call
- Set cookies in Playwright context
- Navigate to dashboard
- High success probability

### Option 2: Manual Recording (15 minutes)
- Use OBS/screen recorder
- Manually demonstrate slide 5 features
- Quick workaround while automation is fixed
- Guaranteed to show actual functionality

### Option 3: Use org-admin-enhanced.html directly (READY NOW)
- Since `orgadmin@e2etest.com` user exists
- Navigate directly to org-admin-enhanced.html
- Hope dashboard initializes without login redirect
- Skip authentication entirely for demo

## Investigation Time

- Total investigation: ~5 hours
- Regeneration attempts: 7 failed
- Root causes found: 3
  1. E2E tests bypassed UI navigation (testing gap)
  2. Login redirect not happening (navigation issue)
  3. Network error prevents API call (Playwright/HTTPS issue)

- `docs/DEMO_MEETING_ROOMS_TAB_INVESTIGATION.md` - Full investigation report
- `scripts/generate_demo_v3_with_integrations.py` - Updated login function (still failing)
- `frontend/html/student-login.html` - Login page JavaScript
- `tests/e2e/test_org_admin_notifications_e2e.py` - Working Selenium approach

## Recommendation

**Use Option 2 (Manual Recording) immediately** to unblock demo completion. Then fix automation in parallel.

This ensures:
- Demo v3.0 can be completed today
- Real functionality is demonstrated
- No risk of more failed automated attempts
- Automation can be fixed without time pressure
