## üìù Next Steps for Implementation

### Phase 1: Prepare Demo Data (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Ensure demo organization exists
# 2. Create/verify 8+ instructors in organization
# 3. Create/verify 2 tracks (Frontend, Backend)
# 4. Test meeting rooms tab access manually
# 5. Verify bulk room creation works
# 6. Verify notification sending works
```

### Phase 2: Update Video Generation Script (1-2 hours)
**File**: `scripts/generate_demo_videos.py` (or create new file)

**Tasks**:
1. Create `generate_slide_05_third_party_integrations()` method
2. Implement Selenium workflow for:
   - Meeting rooms navigation
   - Bulk room creation
   - Notification modal interaction
   - Form filling with JavaScript workarounds
3. Update `generate_all_slides()` to include new slide 5
4. Renumber existing slide methods 5-13 to 6-14
5. Update slide 4 and 14 generation (if narration shown on screen)

**Selenium Code Template** (from planning doc):
```python
def generate_slide_05_third_party_integrations(self):
    """Generate video for Slide 5: Third Party Integrations"""
    print("\nüé• Generating Slide 5: Third Party Integrations (60s)")

    def workflow():
        # Login, navigate, interact with meeting rooms
        # See detailed pseudocode in DEMO_THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
        pass

    self.record_workflow("slide_05_third_party_integrations.mp4", 60, workflow)
```

### Phase 3: Generate Videos (2-3 hours)
```bash
# 1. Test slide 5 generation
python3 scripts/generate_demo_videos.py --slide 5

# 2. Review slide 5 video
mpv frontend/static/demo/videos/slide_05_third_party_integrations.mp4

# 3. Regenerate updated slides
python3 scripts/generate_demo_videos.py --slide 4  # Updated narration
python3 scripts/generate_demo_videos.py --slide 14 # Updated narration

# 4. Generate all slides fresh
python3 scripts/generate_demo_videos.py --all --clean --headless
```

### Phase 4: Update Demo Player (30 minutes)
**File**: `frontend/html/demo-player.html`

**Tasks**:
1. Update `loadSlides()` method with 14 slides
2. Insert slide 5 with video path `/static/demo/videos/slide_05_third_party_integrations.mp4`
3. Use narration from `demo_player_narrations_v3.json`
4. Update total duration display
5. Test timeline navigation with 14 slides

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance (1 hour)
```bash
# 1. Start platform
./scripts/app-control.sh start

# 2. Open demo player
# Navigate to: https://localhost:3000/html/demo-player.html

# 3. Watch complete demo (10 minutes)
# 4. Test all controls (play, pause, prev, next, timeline)
# 5. Verify narration synchronization
# 6. Check video quality and transitions
# 7. Test on different browsers
```
