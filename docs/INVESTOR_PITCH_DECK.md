# Slide 2: The Problem

## $200B+ Market with Broken Tools

### Organizations Face Critical Challenges:

**1. Content Creation Bottleneck**
- Average course takes 40-200 hours to create
- Subject matter experts aren't instructional designers
- Content becomes outdated before it's published

**2. Skills Gap Crisis**
- 44% of workplace skills will change by 2028
- 50% of employees need reskilling
- Training can't keep pace with change

**3. Technical Training is Especially Broken**
- No hands-on lab environments in existing platforms
- Developers learn best by doing, not watching
- Setting up training environments costs $50K+/year

**4. Tool Fragmentation**
- Companies buy 3-5 separate tools (LMS + authoring + labs)
- Average spend: $150K+ across disconnected systems
- Poor user experience, data silos
