# Course Creator Platform - API Documentation

**Version**: 3.0.0 - Password Management & Enhanced UI Features  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-11

## Overview

The Course Creator Platform provides a comprehensive RESTful API for managing courses, users, and content. The API is built using FastAPI and follows REST conventions with a microservices architecture.

**Version 3.0 Highlights:**
- ‚ú® **Password Management System**: Self-service password changes with JWT authentication
- üè¢ **Enhanced Organization Registration**: Automatic admin account creation with password setup
- üîê **Professional Email Validation**: Business-only email enforcement with detailed error handling
- üìù **Comprehensive Form Validation**: Real-time validation with specific error messages

## Microservices Architecture

The platform consists of 8 core backend services including the Enhanced RBAC System:

1. **User Management Service** (Port 8000) - Authentication, user profiles, basic RBAC, **password management system**
2. **Course Generator Service** (Port 8001) - AI-powered content generation
3. **Content Storage Service** (Port 8003) - File storage and versioning
4. **Course Management Service** (Port 8004) - Course CRUD operations and bi-directional feedback
5. **Content Management Service** (Port 8005) - Upload/download and multi-format export
6. **Lab Container Manager Service** (Port 8006) - Individual student Docker container management with multi-IDE support
7. **Analytics Service** (Port 8007) - Student analytics, progress tracking, and learning insights
8. **Organization Management Service** (Port 8008) - Enhanced RBAC System with multi-tenant organization management and **automatic admin account creation with password management**

## Base URLs

- **User Management**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Course Generator**: `http://localhost:8001`
- **Content Storage**: `http://localhost:8003`
- **Course Management**: `http://localhost:8004`
- **Content Management**: `http://localhost:8005`
- **Lab Container Manager**: `http://localhost:8006`
- **Analytics Service**: `http://localhost:8007`
- **Organization Management (RBAC)**: `http://localhost:8008`
- **Production**: `https://your-domain.com/api`

## Authentication

All protected endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### Getting a Token

```http
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "username": "user@example.com",
    "role": "instructor",
    "full_name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations (v3.0)

### Password Security
- **Minimum Requirements**: 8 characters minimum, complexity scoring based on character types
- **Professional Email Enforcement**: Business-only emails required for organization registration (blocks Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
- **Current Password Verification**: Password changes require current password validation
- **JWT Token Authentication**: All password operations require valid JWT tokens
- **Secure Transmission**: Use HTTPS in production for all password-related operations

### Professional Organization Validation
- **Email Domain Filtering**: Automatic rejection of personal email providers
- **Phone Number Validation**: Professional contact numbers required with international format support
- **Address Requirements**: Complete physical addresses required (minimum 10 characters)
- **Slug Uniqueness**: Organization identifiers must be unique across the platform

### Rate Limiting and Security Headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Password change attempts are rate-limited per user
- **CORS Headers**: Proper CORS configuration for browser-based clients
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers for frontend security
- **Authentication Timeouts**: JWT tokens have configurable expiration times

## Organization Management Service (Port 8008) - Enhanced RBAC System

The Organization Management Service provides comprehensive multi-tenant organization management with granular permissions, JWT authentication, Teams/Zoom integration, and audit logging.

### Authentication & Authorization

All RBAC endpoints require JWT authentication with appropriate role-based permissions:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

**Role Hierarchy:**
- **Site Admin**: Full platform access, can manage all organizations
- **Organization Admin**: Manage specific organization, members, tracks, meeting rooms
- **Instructor**: Access assigned projects, create content, manage students
- **Student**: Access enrolled tracks, participate in courses
