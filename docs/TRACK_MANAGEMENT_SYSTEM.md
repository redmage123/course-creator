# Track Management System - Implementation Documentation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Implementation Method:** Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Test Coverage:** 20/20 tests passing (100%)

## Overview

The Track Management System provides comprehensive functionality for managing learning paths (tracks) within a flexible organizational hierarchy that supports optional sub-projects, instructor assignments with communication links, student enrollments, and intelligent load balancing.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Organizations need flexibility in structuring their training programs:
- Some organizations want quarterly sub-projects (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Others want regional sub-projects (EMEA, APAC, Americas)
- Some want tracks directly under main projects with no sub-structure
- All need fair workload distribution across instructors

### Solution

A flexible track assignment system where:
- Sub-projects are **optional** (not mandatory)
- Tracks can belong to **either** a main project **or** a sub-project (XOR constraint)
- Instructors must have communication links (Zoom, Teams, Slack)
- Load balancing is **opt-in** (auto_balance_students flag)
- Minimum 1 instructor per track is enforced
- Org admins can be instructors (dual role support)

## Architecture

### Database Schema

**Modified Tables:**
1. **projects** - Added 3 columns for sub-project support
   - `parent_project_id` - Reference to parent project (NULL for main projects)
   - `is_sub_project` - Boolean flag (FALSE for main, TRUE for sub)
   - `auto_balance_students` - Enable/disable load balancing (defaults to FALSE)

2. **tracks** - Added 1 column for flexible parent reference
   - `sub_project_id` - Reference to sub-project (NULL if track belongs to main project)
   - **XOR Constraint:** Either `project_id` OR `sub_project_id` must be set, not both

**New Tables:**
3. **track_instructors** - Instructor assignments with communication links
   - `id` - UUID primary key
   - `track_id` - Reference to track
   - `user_id` - Instructor user ID
   - `zoom_link` - Zoom meeting link
   - `teams_link` - Microsoft Teams link
   - `slack_links` - JSONB array of Slack channels/DMs
   - `assigned_at` - Assignment timestamp
   - `assigned_by` - Org admin who made assignment
   - **Unique Constraint:** (track_id, user_id)

4. **track_students** - Student enrollments with instructor assignment
   - `id` - UUID primary key
   - `track_id` - Reference to track
   - `student_id` - Student user ID
   - `assigned_instructor_id` - Assigned instructor
   - `enrolled_at` - Enrollment timestamp
   - `assigned_by` - Org admin who made assignment
   - `last_reassigned_at` - Last reassignment timestamp
   - **Unique Constraint:** (track_id, student_id)

**Database Triggers:**
1. **enforce_min_instructors** - Prevents removing last instructor from track
2. **enforce_student_instructor_assignment** - Validates instructor is assigned to track

**Materialized Views:**
1. **track_statistics** - Track counts with instructor/student metrics
2. **instructor_load_distribution** - Instructor workload per track

### Domain Entities

Location: `services/organization-management/organization_management/domain/entities/track.py`

**1. Track Entity**
```python
@dataclass
class Track:
    organization_id: UUID
    name: str
    slug: str
    project_id: Optional[UUID] = None       # Main project
    sub_project_id: Optional[UUID] = None   # Sub-project (XOR)
    track_type: TrackType = TrackType.SEQUENTIAL
    target_audience: List[str] = []
    prerequisites: List[str] = []
    learning_objectives: List[str] = []
    skills_taught: List[str] = []
    difficulty_level: str = "beginner"
    status: TrackStatus = TrackStatus.DRAFT
```

**Key Methods:**
- `validate_parent_reference()` - Enforces XOR constraint
- `activate()` - Activate track for enrollment
- `is_valid()` - Comprehensive validation

**2. TrackInstructor Entity**
```python
@dataclass
class TrackInstructor:
    track_id: UUID
    user_id: UUID
    zoom_link: Optional[str] = None
    teams_link: Optional[str] = None
    slack_links: List[str] = []
```

**Key Methods:**
- `has_communication_links()` - Check if any links provided
- `update_communication_links()` - Update instructor links

**3. TrackStudent Entity**
```python
@dataclass
class TrackStudent:
    track_id: UUID
    student_id: UUID
    assigned_instructor_id: Optional[UUID] = None
```

**Key Methods:**
- `assign_instructor()` - Assign to specific instructor
- `has_instructor()` - Check if assigned

### Application Service

- `create_sub_project()` - Convenience method for sub-projects
- `list_sub_projects()` - List all sub-projects for a parent
- `update_project()` - Update auto-balance setting

**Track Operations:**

- `get_track()` - Retrieve track details

**Instructor Operations:**
- `assign_instructor_to_track()` - Assign with communication links
- `remove_instructor_from_track()` - Remove (enforces minimum 1)

- `reassign_student_to_instructor()` - Change instructor assignment
- `count_students_per_instructor()` - Get current load distribution

**Load Balancing:**
- `auto_balance_students()` - Smart load balancing algorithm

## Load Balancing Algorithm

### Algorithm Details

**Input:** Track ID, List of student IDs to assign

**Process:**
1. **Check Flag** - Verify auto_balance_students is enabled (raises ValueError if not)
2. **Validate Track** - Ensure track has at least 1 instructor
3. **Get Current Loads** - Query current student count per instructor
4. **Initialize Loads** - Create dict with all instructors (including those with 0 students)
5. **Assign Students:**
   - For each student:
     - Sort instructors by current load (ascending)
     - Assign to instructor with lowest load
     - Increment that instructor's load
     - Repeat for next student

**Output:** List of student assignments

**Properties:**
- **Fair Distribution:** Difference between highest and lowest load â‰¤ 1 student
- **Considers Existing Load:** Takes current enrollments into account
- **Opt-In:** Only runs when auto_balance_students = TRUE
- **Deterministic:** Consistent results for same input (secondary sort by instructor ID)

**Example:**
```
Before:
- Instructor A: 5 students
- Instructor B: 2 students
- Instructor C: 0 students

Assign 6 new students:

After:
- Instructor A: 6 students (+1)
- Instructor B: 5 students (+3)
- Instructor C: 5 students (+5)

Distribution: Balanced within 1 student difference
```

## Business Rules

### Mandatory Rules (Enforced by Database & Application)

1. **Sub-Project Hierarchy Rule**
   - Sub-projects MUST have `parent_project_id` set
   - Main projects MUST NOT have `parent_project_id` set
   - Enforced by: Database CHECK constraint + Application validation

2. **Track Parent Reference Rule (XOR Constraint)**
   - Track MUST reference either `project_id` OR `sub_project_id`
   - Track CANNOT reference both
   - Track CANNOT reference neither
   - Enforced by: Database CHECK constraint + Application validation

3. **Minimum Instructor Rule**
   - Every track MUST have at least 1 instructor assigned
   - Cannot remove last instructor from a track
   - Enforced by: Database trigger + Application pre-check

4. **Instructor Assignment Validation Rule**
   - Student can only be assigned to instructors who teach that track
   - Enforced by: Database trigger + Application validation

5. **Unique Assignment Rules**
   - One instructor can only be assigned once per track
   - One student can only be enrolled once per track
   - Enforced by: Database UNIQUE constraints

### Opt-In Rules

6. **Auto-Balance Rule**
   - Load balancing only occurs when `auto_balance_students = TRUE`
   - Defaults to FALSE (must be explicitly enabled)
   - Enforced by: Application logic

## API Usage Examples

### Create Main Project
```python
from organization_management.application.services.track_management_service import create_project

project = create_project(
    organization_id=org_id,
    name="2025 Training Program",
    slug="2025-training"
)
# Result: auto_balance_students = FALSE by default
```

### Create Sub-Project (Optional)
```python
from organization_management.application.services.track_management_service import create_sub_project

sub_project = create_sub_project(
    organization_id=org_id,
    parent_project_id=project['id'],
    name="Q1 2025",
    slug="q1-2025"
)
```

### Create Track Under Main Project
```python
from organization_management.application.services.track_management_service import create_track

track = create_track(
    organization_id=org_id,
    project_id=project['id'],
    sub_project_id=None,  # Track belongs to main project
    name="Application Development",
    slug="app-dev"
)
```

### Create Track Under Sub-Project
```python
track = create_track(
    organization_id=org_id,
    project_id=None,  # Track belongs to sub-project
    sub_project_id=sub_project['id'],
    name="Data Science Fundamentals",
    slug="data-science"
)
```

### Assign Instructor to Track
```python
from organization_management.application.services.track_management_service import assign_instructor_to_track

assignment = assign_instructor_to_track(
    track_id=track['id'],
    instructor_id=instructor_id,
    zoom_link="https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
    teams_link="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/...",
    slack_links=["#dev-track-q1", "@john.doe"]
)
```

### Assign Student to Track
```python
from organization_management.application.services.track_management_service import assign_student_to_track

assignment = assign_student_to_track(
    track_id=track['id'],
    student_id=student_id,
    instructor_id=instructor_id  # Must be assigned to this track
)
```

### Enable Auto-Balance and Assign Students
```python
from organization_management.application.services.track_management_service import (
    update_project,
    auto_balance_students
)

# Enable auto-balance for project
updated_project = update_project(
    project_id=project['id'],
    auto_balance_students=True
)

# Auto-balance 50 students across instructors
student_ids = [uuid4() for _ in range(50)]
assignments = auto_balance_students(
    track_id=track['id'],
    student_ids=student_ids
)
# Result: Students evenly distributed across instructors
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all track management tests
PYTHONPATH=/home/bbrelin/course-creator/services/organization-management:$PYTHONPATH \
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/organization_management/test_subprojects_and_track_assignments.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/unit/organization_management/test_subprojects_and_track_assignments.py::TestLoadBalancingAlgorithm -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/unit/organization_management/test_subprojects_and_track_assignments.py --cov=organization_management -v
```

## Migration

### Running the Migration

```bash
# Apply migration
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d course_creator -f migrations/add_subprojects_and_track_assignments.sql

# Verify migration
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d course_creator -c "SELECT version FROM schema_migrations WHERE version = '20251015_subprojects_track_assignments';"
```

### Rollback (if needed)

The migration includes CASCADE DELETE, so removing tables will clean up all dependent data:

```sql
-- Remove new tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS track_students CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS track_instructors CASCADE;

-- Remove new columns from existing tables
ALTER TABLE tracks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS sub_project_id;
ALTER TABLE projects DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS parent_project_id;
ALTER TABLE projects DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_sub_project;
ALTER TABLE projects DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS auto_balance_students;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

The migration creates indexes on:
- `projects.parent_project_id` - Fast sub-project queries
- `projects.is_sub_project` - Fast filtering
- `tracks.sub_project_id` - Fast track lookups
- `track_instructors.track_id` - Fast instructor queries
- `track_instructors.user_id` - Fast user queries
- `track_students.track_id` - Fast student queries
- `track_students.student_id` - Fast user queries
- `track_students.assigned_instructor_id` - Fast load queries

### Query Optimization

**Load Balancing Query:**
```sql
SELECT assigned_instructor_id, COUNT(*) as student_count
FROM track_students
WHERE track_id = %s AND assigned_instructor_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY assigned_instructor_id
```
- Uses index on `track_id`
- Efficient GROUP BY on indexed column
- O(n) complexity where n = number of students

**Materialized Views:**
- `track_statistics` - Pre-computed track metrics
- `instructor_load_distribution` - Pre-computed instructor loads

Refresh views periodically for up-to-date analytics:
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW track_statistics;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW instructor_load_distribution;
```

## Security Considerations

### Authorization

All operations should verify:
1. User has appropriate role (org_admin, site_admin)
2. User belongs to the organization they're managing
3. User cannot access other organizations' data

**Example (to be implemented in API layer):**
```python
def assign_instructor_to_track(track_id, instructor_id, current_user):
    # Verify current_user is org_admin for this track's organization
    track = get_track(track_id)
    if current_user.organization_id != track.organization_id:
        raise PermissionError("Cannot assign instructors to other organizations")

    # Verify instructor belongs to same organization
    instructor = get_user(instructor_id)
    if instructor.organization_id != track.organization_id:
        raise ValueError("Instructor must belong to same organization")

    # Proceed with assignment
    return service.assign_instructor_to_track(track_id, instructor_id)
```

### Data Validation

All inputs are validated:
- UUIDs are properly formatted
- Strings are sanitized (SQL injection protection via parameterized queries)
- Business rules are enforced at multiple layers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Cannot remove last instructor**
```
ValueError: Cannot remove last instructor
```
**Solution:** Assign another instructor before removing the last one.

**2. Auto-balance not working**
```
ValueError: Auto-balance not enabled
```
**Solution:** Enable auto-balance flag on the project:
```python
update_project(project_id=project_id, auto_balance_students=True)
```

**3. Track creation fails with XOR constraint**
```
ValueError: Track must reference project OR sub-project
```
**Solution:** Ensure exactly one of `project_id` or `sub_project_id` is set:
```python
# Correct - track under main project
create_track(org_id, "Track", "track", project_id=proj_id, sub_project_id=None)

# Correct - track under sub-project
create_track(org_id, "Track", "track", project_id=None, sub_project_id=sub_id)
```

**4. Student assignment fails**
```
ValueError: Instructor not assigned to this track
```
**Solution:** Assign the instructor to the track first:
```python
assign_instructor_to_track(track_id, instructor_id)
assign_student_to_track(track_id, student_id, instructor_id)  # Now works
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Batch Operations**
   - Bulk instructor assignments
   - Bulk student enrollments
   - More efficient for large datasets

   - Time zone considerations

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Real-time instructor workload visualization
   - Student distribution charts
   - Track completion metrics

4. **Communication Integration**
   - Auto-create Zoom meetings
   - Auto-provision Teams channels
   - Auto-invite to Slack channels

5. **Notification System**
   - Notify instructors when students assigned
   - Notify students of instructor details
   - Email/SMS integration
