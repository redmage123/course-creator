Enrollment Service Implementation - Student Course Access and Progress Management

This module implements the enrollment service layer, orchestrating complex student enrollment
workflows, progress tracking, and learning outcome management within the educational platform.
It manages the complete student journey from initial course registration through completion.

ARCHITECTURAL RESPONSIBILITIES:
The EnrollmentService coordinates all enrollment-related business operations, maintaining
enrollment state integrity, enforcing educational policies, and providing comprehensive
progress tracking for both students and instructors.

BUSINESS WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION:
1. Student Registration: Course eligibility validation and enrollment creation
2. Progress Tracking: Continuous monitoring of student advancement through courses
3. Status Management: Active, suspended, cancelled, and completed enrollment states
4. Certification: Automated and manual certificate issuance upon completion
5. Analytics Integration: Learning progress data for educational insights
6. Bulk Operations: Efficient mass enrollment for institutional use

EDUCATIONAL POLICY ENFORCEMENT:
- Course Availability: Only published courses accept new enrollments
- Duplicate Prevention: Students cannot enroll multiple times in same course
- Progress Validation: Percentage tracking with business rule enforcement
- Completion Standards: Criteria validation for course completion recognition
- Certificate Eligibility: Quality assurance for credential issuance

STUDENT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
- Registration Phase: Eligibility validation → Enrollment creation → Access provisioning
- Learning Phase: Progress tracking → Performance monitoring → Intervention triggers
- Completion Phase: Achievement validation → Certificate issuance → Analytics update
- Administrative Phase: Status modifications → Access control → Audit trail

INSTRUCTOR SUPPORT FEATURES:
- Class Management: Comprehensive enrollment oversight for course instances
- Progress Monitoring: Real-time student advancement tracking
- Intervention Tools: Early warning systems for at-risk students
- Performance Analytics: Statistical insights into student outcomes
- Bulk Administration: Efficient class-wide enrollment management

ANALYTICS AND REPORTING:
- Completion Rates: Course effectiveness and student success metrics
- Progress Patterns: Learning velocity and engagement analysis
- Intervention Metrics: Early warning system effectiveness
- Certificate Tracking: Credential issuance and verification statistics
- Comparative Analysis: Cross-course and longitudinal performance studies

INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
- Course Service: Validation of course availability and publication status
- User Service: Student identity verification and profile management
- Analytics Service: Learning progress and outcome data streaming
- Certificate Service: Credential generation and verification systems
- Notification Service: Automated communications for enrollment events

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Bulk Processing: Efficient handling of mass enrollment operations
- Async Operations: Non-blocking I/O for all database interactions
- Caching Strategy: Optimized access to frequently queried enrollment data
- Event Sourcing: Complete audit trail for compliance and analytics

DATA INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE:
- FERPA Compliance: Educational record privacy and access control
- Audit Trails: Complete history of enrollment changes and events
- Data Retention: Compliance with institutional and regulatory requirements
- Security Controls: Access validation and authorization enforcement
