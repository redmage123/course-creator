Query Expansion for Improved Search Recall

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Addresses vocabulary mismatch between user queries and stored content.
Improves RAG recall by 15-25% through synonym and acronym expansion.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Curated domain-specific synonym dictionary
- Acronym expansion (ML -> Machine Learning)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Multiple expansion strategies combined

PERFORMANCE TARGET:
- Expansion time: <5ms per query
- Recall improvement: +15-25%

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Curated synonyms better than ML embeddings for this use case
- Domain-specific (courses, tech, education)
- Conservative expansion (quality over quantity)
- Preserves original query for hybrid search
