Session Service Interface - Authentication Session Business Logic

This module defines the abstract interfaces for session-related business operations
within the User Management Service. It provides clean separation between session
management logic and token handling operations.

Architectural Benefits:
    Interface Segregation: Separate concerns for session and token management
    Security Focus: Designed for secure authentication and session handling
    Business Logic Encapsulation: Hides complex session rules behind simple interfaces
    Testability: Enables comprehensive testing of authentication flows
    Performance Optimization: Interfaces designed for high-frequency auth operations

Service Separation:
    ISessionService: Session lifecycle and management operations
    ITokenService: JWT token generation, validation, and refresh operations
    
This separation allows for different implementation strategies and better
maintainability of authentication-related code.

Security Considerations:
    - Session validation is critical for every authenticated request
    - Token services handle sensitive cryptographic operations
    - Session cleanup prevents resource exhaustion attacks
    - Revocation operations support security incident response
