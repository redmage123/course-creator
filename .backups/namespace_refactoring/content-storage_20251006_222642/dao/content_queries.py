"""
Content Queries DAO - Centralized SQL Query Management for Content Operations

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:
All SQL queries for content metadata operations centralized in one location following
DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Static class containing all SQL queries as string constants, eliminating
inline SQL in repository classes and providing single source of truth
for content database schema interactions.

QUERY CATEGORIES:
- Content CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, delete content records
- Search Operations: Advanced search with multiple filter criteria
- Metadata Operations: Content metadata and classification management
- Analytics Operations: Content usage statistics and reporting
