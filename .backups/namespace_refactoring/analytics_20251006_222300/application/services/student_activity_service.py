    Student Activity Service - Comprehensive Student Engagement Analytics
    
    BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:
    Track and analyze student learning activities to provide instructors with actionable
    insights about student engagement, progress patterns, and learning effectiveness.
    This enables data-driven decisions for course improvement and student support.
    
    TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
    - Activity recording with validation and context checking
    - Engagement scoring using weighted activity types
    - Learning pattern detection through temporal and sequence analysis
    - Real-time analytics cache invalidation for immediate data consistency
    - Risk assessment through activity pattern analysis
    
    KEY FEATURES:
    - Multi-dimensional engagement scoring (login, lab usage, quiz completion, etc.)
    - Suspicious activity detection and validation
    - Learning pattern recognition for personalized recommendations
    - Performance optimization through Redis caching with automatic invalidation
    - Comprehensive activity summarization and reporting

        It ensures data integrity, prevents abuse, and maintains real-time analytics
        consistency through immediate cache invalidation.

        4. Side effect handling (notifications, real-time updates)
