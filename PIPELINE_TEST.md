# Pipeline Test

This file is created to test the updated CI/CD pipeline.

## Test Details
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Purpose**: Verify SOLID testing framework integration with GitHub Actions
- **Expected**: All test suites should pass with new framework

## Pipeline Components Being Tested
1. ✅ Backend Unit Tests (SOLID framework)
2. ✅ Frontend Unit Tests (Jest + Python)  
3. ✅ Integration Tests (Docker Compose)
4. ✅ E2E Tests (Playwright)
5. ✅ Security Tests (Bandit + Safety)
6. ✅ Lint & Quality (ESLint + Python)
7. ✅ Performance Tests (if main branch)

Pipeline should now use:
```bash
python tests/main_test_runner.py --type <type> --coverage --ci
```

Instead of the old broken commands.
