"""
TDD RED Phase: Guest Role RBAC Unit Tests

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:
Guest users need limited, read-only access to demo service and public content
to explore the platform before registration. This reduces friction for potential
customers while maintaining security and data protection.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT:
- Guest role in RBAC system with specific permissions
- Time-limited sessions (30 minutes inactivity timeout)
- Read-only enforcement (no create/update/delete operations)
- Rate limiting for AI assistant access
- Automatic session cleanup

TEST METHODOLOGY: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
These tests are written FIRST (RED phase) and will FAIL until implementation is complete.
