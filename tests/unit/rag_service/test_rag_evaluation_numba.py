Unit Tests for Numba-Optimized RAG Evaluation Functions

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:
Ensure numba-optimized functions produce identical results to Python implementation
while achieving 10x+ performance improvement.

TEST STRATEGY (TDD):
1. Write tests first (this file)
2. Implement numba-optimized functions
3. Verify behavioral equivalence
4. Measure performance improvements

CPU-INTENSIVE FUNCTIONS IDENTIFIED:
1. _simple_text_similarity() - Called N*M times for context matching
2. _calculate_faithfulness() - Sentence-level word overlap calculations
3. _calculate_aggregated_metrics() - Array operations on large result sets
