"""
Comprehensive End-to-End Tests for RAG AI Assistant Workflow Across ALL Roles

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:
Tests the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI Assistant functionality across all user roles,
validating that AI responses are contextually relevant, role-appropriate, and leverage the
knowledge graph for personalized learning assistance.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Uses Selenium WebDriver with Page Object Model pattern
- Tests against HTTPS frontend (https://localhost:3000)
- Covers RAG AI Assistant for ALL 5 user roles (Student, Instructor, Org Admin, Site Admin, Guest)
- Validates knowledge graph integration, semantic search, and context-aware responses
- Tests multi-turn conversations, citation verification, and progressive disclosure

TEST COVERAGE BY ROLE:
1. Student RAG Interactions (Learning Questions, Quiz Hints, Concept Explanations)
2. Instructor RAG Interactions (Course Design, Content Generation, Pedagogical Insights)
3. Organization Admin RAG Interactions (Analytics Insights, Training Recommendations)
4. Site Admin RAG Interactions (Platform Analytics, System Optimization)
5. Cross-Role RAG Features (Knowledge Graph Traversal, Context Persistence)

PRIORITY: P0 (CRITICAL) - RAG AI Assistant is a core platform differentiator
