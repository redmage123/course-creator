## Test Data Management

### Test Data Factories

Create reusable test data factories for:

- Users (admin, instructor, student, org admin)
- Organizations
- Courses (various states: draft, published, archived)
- Content (syllabus, slides, quizzes, labs)
- Enrollments
- Progress data
- Analytics data

### Database Seeding

```python
# Example: tests/e2e/fixtures/database_seed.py

def seed_complete_platform():
    """Seed database with realistic test data"""
    org = create_organization()
    admin = create_site_admin()
    instructor = create_instructor(org)
    students = create_students(org, count=50)
    courses = create_courses(instructor, count=20)
    enroll_students(students, courses)
    generate_progress_data(students, courses)
    return {
        'org': org,
        'admin': admin,
        'instructor': instructor,
        'students': students,
        'courses': courses
    }
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive E2E test plan ensures **every feature and pathway** in the Course Creator platform is thoroughly tested **across ALL 5 user roles**. Implementation of this plan will:

- ✅ Increase confidence in releases
- ✅ Catch bugs before production for ALL user types
- ✅ Improve user experience for ALL roles
- ✅ Reduce manual testing effort
- ✅ Enable safe refactoring
- ✅ Support rapid feature development
- ✅ Validate RBAC and multi-tenant isolation
- ✅ Ensure role permission boundaries enforced

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **ALL 4 authenticated roles + guest** must have complete workflow coverage
- **Role transitions** must be tested (user switching between roles within same org)
- **Permission boundaries** must be validated for each role
- **Multi-tenant isolation** must be verified (org admins cannot access other orgs)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve test plan
2. Assign resources (2-3 QA engineers - one per role group)
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation (all role workflows)
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
5. Monitor coverage metrics weekly (broken down by role)

**Resource Allocation:**
- **Engineer 1:** Student + Guest roles (Weeks 1-3)
- **Engineer 2:** Instructor role (Weeks 1-3)
- **Engineer 3:** Organization Admin + Site Admin roles (Weeks 1-3)
- **All Engineers:** Feature deep dives (Weeks 4-7)
- **All Engineers:** Integration & refinement (Weeks 8-10)
