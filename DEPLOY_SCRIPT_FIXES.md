# Deploy Script Fixes - Ubuntu Deployment Script

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ CRITICAL: Bash Syntax Error (Lines 3-24)
**Problem**: The script used Python-style `"""` multiline comments which are invalid in bash, causing "File name too long" errors.

**Solution**: Converted multiline comments to proper bash `#` comments.

### 2. ❌ CRITICAL: User Permission Verification Timing  
**Problem**: The script was trying to verify `appuser` permissions immediately after user creation, before Docker was installed and configured, causing `sudo: unknown user appuser` and audit plugin errors.

**Solution**: 
- Moved `verify_user_permissions()` to run after all systems are set up
- Added user existence checks before attempting sudo operations
- Added timeout and error handling for sudo commands
- Added better error messages and fallback behavior

### 3. ❌ CRITICAL: Premature sudo Commands
**Problem**: Multiple functions were trying to use `sudo -u "$APP_USER"` before the user was created:
- `install_nodejs()` - Line 1085
- `python_strategy_3_pyenv()` - Lines 867, 875 
- `venv_strategy_1_standard_venv()` - Line 921
- `venv_strategy_2_virtualenv()` - Line 943
- `install_microservice_dependencies()` - Line 2044
- `build_docker_images()` - Line 1926
- `deploy_with_docker()` - Line 1958
- `check_docker_deployment_health()` - Line 1996

**Solution**: Added user existence checks (`if ! id "$APP_USER" &>/dev/null`) before all sudo operations.

### 4. Enhanced User Permission Verification
**Improvements**:
- Check if users exist before testing permissions
- Use `timeout` command to prevent hanging on sudo operations
- Only test directories that actually exist
- Better Docker access testing with informative messages
- Graceful handling when Docker is not available

### 5. User Creation Robustness
**Improvements**:
- Added additional sleep time for user creation to propagate (3 seconds + 2 seconds)
- Enhanced error checking in `setup_docker_permissions()`
- Verify users exist before adding to Docker group
- Wait for group membership changes to propagate

### 6. Project Installation
**Added**: New `copy_course_creator_project()` function that:
- Automatically copies the current Course Creator project to the installation directory
- Handles running from different locations (current dir or parent dir)
- Excludes unnecessary files (logs, cache, git, etc.)
- Sets proper ownership and permissions
- Works with force reinstall option

### 7. System Dependencies
**Added**: `rsync` to system packages for reliable file copying

## Key Changes Made

### Function: `verify_user_permissions()`
- Added user existence checks
- Added timeout to sudo commands
- Added directory existence checks
- Better Docker availability testing
- More informative error messages

### Function: `create_service_user()`
- Increased sleep time for user propagation
- Added final wait for user changes to propagate

### Function: `setup_docker_permissions()`
- Added user existence verification before group operations
- Added wait time for group membership propagation
- Better error handling and logging

### Function: `copy_course_creator_project()` (NEW)
- Intelligent project detection
- Handles multiple source directory scenarios
- Proper file filtering and permissions
- Integration with force reinstall option

### Main Deployment Flow
- Moved user permission verification to the end of deployment
- Added project copying after user creation
- Better error handling throughout

## Usage

The fixed script now:
1. Creates users properly with adequate propagation time
2. Copies the Course Creator project to the installation directory
3. Sets up Docker permissions correctly
4. Verifies everything works at the end of deployment
5. Provides better error messages and troubleshooting information

## Files Modified
- `deploy-ubuntu.sh` - Main deployment script with all fixes applied
- `deploy-ubuntu.sh.fixed` - Backup of the fixed version

## Testing Recommendation
Test the script in a clean Ubuntu environment to verify all fixes work correctly.
